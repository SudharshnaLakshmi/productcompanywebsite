            Welcome to E-MART Limited!
             E-MART is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, 
             independent bookstores.
             We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. 
             They’re where authors can connect with readers, 
             where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of 
             reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.
            <br />
            We hope that Bookshop can help strengthen the fragile ecosystem and margins around bookselling 
            and keep local bookstores an integral part of our culture and communities.
            Bookshop is a benefit corporation - a corporation dedicated to the public good.
